<p>Welcome to my coding journal!</p>
<p>February 28, 2020: I started to create my website. I have finished my person card. I am working on my website.</p>
<p>March 3, 2020: I am continuing to work on my website and improve it.</p>
<p>March 6, 2020: I am beginning the creation of a website for a friend of mine.</p>
<p>March 10, 2020: I am continuing to make the website for my friend. It is going well.</p>
<p>April 8, 2020 (my birthday): Ciara and I worked on our code sketch. This is a link to our project: <a href="https://spring-break-horror.glitch.me/">Our Codesketch</a> <br><br> I also continued to work on The Mystery of Sutherland Manor, an interactive murder mystery.</p>
<p>April 21, 2020: I am beginning to work on an array codesketch. I am planning on having a button which when pressed shows or has some sort of  effect, using an event listener function.</p>
<p>April 26, 2020: I am continuing to work on my array codesketch. I think it is going well.</p>
<p>May 3, 2020: I am continuing to work on my array codesketch! I think it is going pretty, I have added the event listener and I am working on the next part of the codesketch.</p>
<p>May 8, 2020: I am working on my Mother's Day codesketch. It is going really well! I am almost finished with it.</p>
<p>May 9, 2020: I finished working on my Mother's Day codesketch!</p>
<p>May 12, 2020 (in response to the Justice System and Algorithms podcast): I don't think that someone's past actions can predict their future actions. In some cases, they can and people can repeat past mistakes or events. However, I think that people can change and they can't always be held accountable for mistakes they made in the past. I'm not sure that someone's actions can be based on statistics. I think that there are many ways in which a statistic would not be useful, but there are cases in which it might be better to have a statistic. I think that it really depends on the case. I have heard of algorithms being used to sentence people in a trial, but I learned more about it in the podcast. I think that humans versus algotrithms is, as I said, dependent on the case. Overall, I really enjoyed listening to this podcast!</p>
