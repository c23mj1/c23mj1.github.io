<p><h2>My Journal</h2><h3><center>A journal of all my coding projects and when I completed them.</center></h3></p>
<p><b>February 28, 2020:</b> I started to create my website. I have finished my <a href="personcard.html">person card</a>. I am working on my website. (This part was added on May 13, 2020): I don't know the exact date of when I made my first <a href="codesketch1.html"> codesketch</a> so I decided to put it here.</p>

<p><b>March 3, 2020:</b> I am continuing to work on my website and improve it.</p>

<p><b>March 6, 2020:</b> I am beginning the creation of a website for a friend of mine.</p>

<p><b>March 10, 2020:</b> I am continuing to make the website for my friend. It is going well.</p>

<p><b>Around March 27, 2020:</b> This is around the time when I began working on The Mystery of Sutherland Manor. The Mystery of Sutherland Manor is an interactive murder msytery. I am using twine, a website which will help me create the story. It's a murder mystery, and the idea is that murderer will change depending on which plots are chosen. My full idea for it includes interactive puzzles and sounds to make the mystery more complete. March 27, 2020 is when I began the actual work of the project and the beginnings of the story.</p>
<!-- This was added on June 9, 2020 when I realized that I hadn't explained the project yet so I went back -->


<p><b>April 8, 2020 (my birthday):</b> Ciara and I worked on our code sketch. This is a link to our project: <a href="https://spring-break-horror.glitch.me/">Our Codesketch</a>. I also continued to work on The Mystery of Sutherland Manor, an interactive murder mystery.</p>


<p><b>April 21, 2020:</b> I am beginning to work on an array codesketch. I am planning on having a button which when pressed shows or has some sort of  effect, using an event listener function.</p>

<p><b>April 26, 2020:</b> I am continuing to work on my array codesketch. I think it is going well.</p>

<p><b>May 3, 2020:</b> I am continuing to work on my array codesketch! I think it is going pretty, I have added the event listener and I am working on the next part of the codesketch.</p>

<p><b>May 8, 2020:</b> I am working on my Mother's Day codesketch. It is going really well! I am almost finished with it.</p>

<p><b>May 9, 2020:</b> I finished working on my <a href="mothersday.html">Mother's Day</a> codesketch!</p>

<p><b>May 12, 2020 (in response to the Justice System and Algorithms podcast):</b> I don't think that someone's past actions can predict their future actions. In some cases, they can and people can repeat past mistakes or events. However, I think that people can change and they can't always be held accountable for mistakes they made in the past. I'm not sure that someone's actions can be based on statistics. I think that there are many ways in which a statistic would not be useful, but there are cases in which it might be better to have a statistic. I think that it really depends on the case. I have heard of algorithms being used to sentence people in a trial, but I learned more about it in the podcast. I think that humans versus algotrithms is, as I said, dependent on the case. Overall, I really enjoyed listening to this podcast!</p>

<p><b>May 13, 2020:</b> I just finished a <a href="animals.html">codesketch</a>. It has an array, so it's an array codesketch. In making this, I learned about event listeners and arrays. I really enjoyed making this!</p>

<p><b>June 7, 2020:</b> I finished another one of the plotlines for The Mystery of Sutherland Manor! I have now completed about 3 of the stories. I am hoping to do a couple more and finish it soon!</p> <!-- added on June 9, so roughly when I was working on it -->

<p><b>June 11, 2020 (Arch Day):</b> I have finished The Mystery of Sutherland Manor!!! Hopefully I will continue to add more and continue to grow the story. I am interested in adding sound effects, puzzles, and more plotlines. However, here it is: <a href="sutherland.html">The Mystery of Sutherland Manor</a>
