<p><h2>My Journal</h2><h3><center>A journal of all my coding projects and when I completed them.</center></h3></p>
<p><b>February 28, 2020:</b> I started to create my website. I have finished my <a href="personcard.html">person card</a>. I am working on my website. (This part was added on May 13, 2020): I don't know the exact date of when I made my first <a href="codesketch1.html"> codesketch</a> so I decided to put it here.</p>

<p><b>March 3, 2020:</b> I am continuing to work on my website and improve it.</p>

<p><b>March 6, 2020:</b> I am beginning the creation of a website for a friend of mine.</p>

<p><b>March 10, 2020:</b> I am continuing to make the website for my friend. It is going well.</p>

<p><b>April 8, 2020 (my birthday):</b> Ciara and I worked on our code sketch. This is a link to our project: <a href="https://spring-break-horror.glitch.me/">Our Codesketch</a> <br><br> I also continued to work on The Mystery of Sutherland Manor, an interactive murder mystery.</p>

<p><b>April 21, 2020:</b> I am beginning to work on an array codesketch. I am planning on having a button which when pressed shows or has some sort of  effect, using an event listener function.</p>

<p><b>April 26, 2020:</b> I am continuing to work on my array codesketch. I think it is going well.</p>

<p><b>May 3, 2020:</b> I am continuing to work on my array codesketch! I think it is going pretty, I have added the event listener and I am working on the next part of the codesketch.</p>

<p><b>May 8, 2020:</b> I am working on my Mother's Day codesketch. It is going really well! I am almost finished with it.</p>

<p><b>May 9, 2020:</b> I finished working on my <a href="mothersday.html">Mother's Day</a> codesketch!</p>

<p><b>May 12, 2020 (in response to the Justice System and Algorithms podcast):</b> I don't think that someone's past actions can predict their future actions. In some cases, they can and people can repeat past mistakes or events. However, I think that people can change and they can't always be held accountable for mistakes they made in the past. I'm not sure that someone's actions can be based on statistics. I think that there are many ways in which a statistic would not be useful, but there are cases in which it might be better to have a statistic. I think that it really depends on the case. I have heard of algorithms being used to sentence people in a trial, but I learned more about it in the podcast. I think that humans versus algotrithms is, as I said, dependent on the case. Overall, I really enjoyed listening to this podcast!</p>

<p><b>May 13, 2020:</b> I just finished a <a href="animals.html">codesketch</a>. It has an array, so it's an array codesketch. In making this, I learned about event listeners and arrays. I really enjoyed making this!</p>
